## Introduction
This repository contains the scripts which are used for 3D mineral prospectivity modeling.

## Mineral prospectivity modeling
### Weights of Evidence (WofE)
The scripts provided for creating the posterior probability and studentized posterior probability models can be found in WofE folder.
