## Introduction
This repository contains the scripts used for 3D mineral prospectivity modeling.

## Mineral prospectivity modeling
### Ordinary and fuzzy weights of evidence
The scripts required for creating posterior probability and studentized posterior probability models using the ordinary and fuzzy weights of evidence methods can be found in "WofE" and "Fuzzy WofE" folders, respectively.
